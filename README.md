# mikutter favstar
Favstar clone service with mikutter or simple ruby script

## About and Idea
This serves minimally, mostly Web UI for Favstar.
Core services such as totaling favs are taken by users using local daemon service.
Users send favs and RTs to this service and this serves only Web UI.

## Status
Early part of development.

## Plan
* Teokure point system.
* User can define secret key for management and sending his or her favs and RTs.
